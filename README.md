This application is a simple demonstration of how the Outbound Message service can be implemented. 

I use this to demonstrate outbound message as well as the Partner API. 

This is demo code, so things like proper session handling in Heroku might need to be thought of if you want to build this out a litle better. 

Also, this is a work in progress so has some classes at the moment around OAuth handling and also thinking about how i can edit and submit back to SAlesforce.
